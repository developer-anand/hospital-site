              Technology can aid older adults' mental health and medication

            </h3>

            <p>
              It can be devastating to watch older adults struggle with memory
              problems, low mood, anxiety, or a lack of motivation, particularly
              during times of physical distancing. With waiting lists for mental
              health appointments stretching for months, you may be wondering
              about alternatives. Reaching out to family members or faith
              leaders may be helpful in talking through stressors.
              Alternatively, self-help books may provide skills or a new
              perspective for older adults choosing to keep their struggles
              private.

            <h3>A muscle-building obsession in boys: What to know and do</h3>

            <p>
              By the time boys are 8 or 10, they're steeped in Marvel action
              heroes with bulging, oversized muscles and rock-hard abs. By
              adolescence, they're deluged with social media streams of
              bulked-up male bodies. The underlying messages about power and
              worth prompt many boys to worry and wonder about how to measure
              up. Sometimes, negative thoughts and concerns even interfere with
              daily life, a mental health issue known body dysmorphic disorder,
              or body dysmorphia. The most common form of this in boys is muscle
              dysmorphia.

              Dementia: Coping with common, sometimes distressing behaviors
            </h3>

            <p>
              Dementia poses many challenges, both for people struggling with it
              and for those close to them. It can be hard to witness and cope
              with common behaviors that arise from illnesses like Alzheimer's
              disease, vascular dementia, or frontotemporal dementia. Caring for
              a person who has dementia may be frustrating, confusing, or
              upsetting at times. Understanding why certain behaviors occur and
              learning ways to handle a variety of situations can help smooth
              the path ahead.

              Screening tests may save lives ‚Äî so when is it time to stop?
            </h3>

            <p>
              Screening tests, such as Pap smears or blood pressure checks,
              could save your life. They can detect a disease you have no reason
              to suspect is there. Early detection may allow treatment while a
              health condition is curable and before irreversible complications
              arise. Some screening tests help prevent the disease they are
              designed to detect. For example, colonoscopies and Pap smears can
              identify precancerous abnormalities that can be addressed so they
              cannot continue to grow and become cancerous.

            <h3>Does running cause arthritis?</h3>

            <p>
              You may think the answer is obvious. Surely, years of running
              (pounding pavements, or even softer surfaces) could wear out your
              joints, much like tires wear out after you put enough miles on
              them. And osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis,
              usually affects older adults. In fact, it's often described as
              age-related and degenerative.
